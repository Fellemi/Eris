            <h4>Atlas</h4>
            <p>I'm a nonbinary, autistic teen with an astronomy and linguistic interest. (Somewhat interested in design too, but saying that while only having this site to prove it would be counterproductive.)</p>
            <p>The sole goal with Eris it to make my siblings learn the names of the dwarfplanets. Maybe annoy them with the chaotic design too.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Tofu</h4>
            <p>The best smol kitten.</p>
            <p>He isn't that much of a programmer, but loves to contribute by sleeping on keyboards when they're being used. </p>
